#F.A.S.T. Guardian

F.A.S.T was created during the 2025 Data Minds Competition, where we were given the healthcare theme and tasked with building a data focused solution.


F.A.S.T. Guardian is an AI-powered stroke detection app that analyzes facial expressions, arm movement, and speech patterns to detect early stroke symptoms using only a smartphone. The app follows the F.A.S.T. (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) framework and provides instant emergency alerts when needed.
